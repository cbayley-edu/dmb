        Dave Matthews Band's 1994 major label debut album, Under the Table and Dreaming, 
        brought the band worldwide fame and was eventually certified six times platinum. 
        As of 2018, the band had sold more than 20 million concert tickets and a combined 
        total of 38 million CDs and DVDs. Their 2018 album, Come Tomorrow, debuted at #1 
        on the Billboard 200, making DMB the first band to have seven consecutive studio 
        albums debut at the peak. The band won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal 
        Performance by a Duo or Group for "So Much to Say".
